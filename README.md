# Credit-Card_Fault_Detector

Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset used for this project contains transaction details, and the goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

Features

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and seaborn

Feature scaling and transformation

Model training using machine learning algorithms

Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
Usage

Load the dataset and preprocess it.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

Train the machine learning model using different classifiers.

Evaluate the model performance and tune hyperparameters.

Predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or genuine.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset.

It contains transaction details along with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

Model Training

The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks are tested.

Performance metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are analyzed.

Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

Fraud detection rates and false positive rates are compared among different models.

Future Improvements

Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Autoencoders)

Use advanced feature engineering techniques

Deploy the model as a web service
